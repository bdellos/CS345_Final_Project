"""
__init__.py file marks directory as a package

From here we can import any custom classes we define using
nice, clean imports.

=== EXAMPLE ===
In this file:
    from .player import Player
    from .goalie import Goalie
In the file we want to have the classes imported to:
    from will_it_score.player import Player
    from will_it_score.goalie import Goalie
